# Mock services for the Red Hat Insights Platform core services

## Inventory Service
The idea of inventory is crucial and ubiquitous for applications on the platform.  A single view of inventory, from a userâ€™s point of view, is necessary for providing a cohesive experience.  This proposal outlines a set of requirements and themes for an initial implementation of a centralized inventory service.

The primary object represented by the inventory service is called an entity.  An entity could be a host, a network device, an abstract organizing unit (like an openshift cluster), or a cloud object like an AWS S3 bucket.
